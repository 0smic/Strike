# Strike

This python code identify the host os and make a reverse shell to the attacker machine

You need to change the Ip address and the Port in the file before you run this in the target machine.

Also you need to use Netcat to listen in the specific port you given in the file.

Eg: nc -l -p 9191

Remember it's this shell is not fully stable
